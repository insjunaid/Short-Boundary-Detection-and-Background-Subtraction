# Short-Boundary-Detection-and-Background-Subtraction




Short-Boundary Detection and Background Subtraction are essential techniques in computer vision, primarily used for object detection and tracking in dynamic scenes.

Short-Boundary Detection:

This process involves identifying shorter edges or boundaries in an image, typically to focus on regions of interest or isolate specific objects. By emphasizing shorter contours, it becomes easier to detect fine details or objects that might be obscured in cluttered environments.

Background Subtraction: This technique extracts the foreground (moving objects or regions of interest) from a static or changing background. It works by creating a model of the background and subtracting it from the current frame of a video or image, leaving behind only the dynamic elements. Background subtraction is widely used in video surveillance, traffic monitoring, and similar applications.

When combined, these methods enable robust detection of objects in scenes with complex or dynamic backgrounds, making them suitable for tasks like safe driving assistance, surveillance systems, and augmented reality.
